### Steps and Diagram Names for a Software Architecture Kata Team Response
1. Understand the Kata Requirements- The Problem
Meet with the team to discuss the Kata and what it asks for.
2. Identify Stakeholders and Concerns
Diagram: "Stakeholder Matrix"
Identify who the stakeholders are and what their concerns and requirements are.
3. Define System Boundaries and Context
Diagram: "Context Diagram"
Outline what the system should do and how it will interact with external entities.
4. Decompose the System into Domains
Diagram: "Decomposition Diagram"
Break the system down into smaller parts or domains.
5. Identify Services and Components
Diagram: "Component Diagram"
List the services and components that make up each domain.
6. Define Interaction Between Services
Diagram: "Sequence Diagram"
Detail how the services will communicate and interact with each other.
7. Choose Technologies
Diagram: "Technology Stack Diagram"
Decide what technologies will be used for each service or component.
8. Identify Data Flows and Data Stores
Diagram: "Data Flow Diagram"
Describe how data will move through the system and where it will be stored.
9. Specify Non-Functional Requirements
Diagram: "Non-Functional Requirements Checklist"
Detail requirements like performance, security, and scalability.
10. Prototype Critical Parts
Create minimal prototypes to validate crucial aspects of the architecture.
11. Review and Iterate
Diagram: "Feedback Loop Diagram"
Regularly review the architecture and iterate based on feedback.
12. Document the Architecture
Diagram: "Architecture Overview Diagram"
Summarize the architecture, including all services, interactions, and technologies, in a comprehensive but easy-to-read format.
13. Final Review and Presentation
Diagram: "Final Architecture Diagram"
Finalize the architecture and present it to stakeholders for approval.
14. Implementation Roadmap
Diagram: "Implementation Roadmap Timeline"
Develop a plan for implementing the architecture, broken down into phases and sprints.
15. Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
Diagram: "Monitoring Dashboard Layout"
Plan how to monitor the system once it's implemented, including key performance indicators (KPIs) to track.
By following these steps and utilizing the corresponding diagrams, your architecture team will be able to comprehensively tackle the Kata with a well-planned and articulated approach.
